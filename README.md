Hi, thank you for dedicating your time to review this project. My goals for this project is to find out whether there is a correlation between numbers of internet user in a country and it's country's GDP.
Besides that, I want to showcase the knowledge and skills that I earned from taking an online course in data science.
The data I'm using in this project is from kaggle.
